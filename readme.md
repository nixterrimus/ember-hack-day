# Ember Day Hack Project

This is a project to play with ember.

The `master` branch has a base, booting copy of ember on it.   It was
setup using the guide from "Master Space and Time with Javascript:
Book 4 Ember"

Look at `application.js` to see what's required and where the ember app
is created.

Other branchesÂ will contain work beyond the base application, check
those out if you're curious.
